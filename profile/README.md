# Hi, we're ReadMe! :wave:

<a href="https://readme.com" target="_blank"><img src="../oss-banner.svg"></a>

Welcome to our GitHub org! [At ReadMe][readme], we want developers to succeed. That's why building thoughtful developer experiences is at the core of everything we do.

### And by “developer”, we mean a _lot_ of people…

:memo:   [Anyone who builds API docs](https://readme.com/customers) on ReadMe. <br>
:monocle_face:   People who use API docs built on ReadMe. <br>
:floppy_disk:   Folks who use any of our open source libraries. <br>
:dancers:   [The ReadMe team](https://readme.com/about).[^come-work-with-us] <br>
:rainbow:   Honestly? [Pretty much everyone](http://amiarealdeveloper.com)!

### We :blue_heart: open source, y'all.

Running an open source project? Let us know and and [we'll get you a ReadMe license for free](https://docs.readme.com/docs/upgrade-plan#open-source)! We're proud members of [the OpenAPI Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/) and [the Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/), and maintain dozens of open source tools for working with APIs, the OpenAPI Specification, Markdown, and more.

### But most of all?

We're excited to see what you build with ReadMe! :owl:

[readme]: https://readme.com
[api]: https://github.com/readmeio/api 'magically generates SDKs from an OpenAPI definition :magic_wand:'
[markdown]: https://github.com/readmeio/markdown 'our ReadMe-flavored Markdown parser and React-based rendering engine :writing_hand:'
[rdme]: https://github.com/readmeio/rdme 'the official ReadMe CLI and GitHub Action :shell:'

[^come-work-with-us]: Are you as excited about APIs as we are? Do you care deeply (maybe _too_ deeply) about documentation? Do you geek out over amazing web design? [**We're hiring**](https://readme.com/careers), and we'd love to work with you! 🎉
